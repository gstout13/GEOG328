**Exploring the relationship between human and machine, muscle and and tire**
*Newton's Third Law states that for every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction. Perhaps this relationship is seen most vividly in the pedal jockeys who ride the narrow line between speed and risk."*


## What Is A Fixed-Gear Bicycle?
In its utmost, a bicycle serves as both a mode of transportation and a recreational output, intent on putting humanity to its test of endurance in the pursuit of speed. A fixed-gear bicycle, while  having both experienced, and passed, its cultural prime, is one of the most primitive and direct ways of accessing the primeval drive to transition through space. Much like the original, first generation bicycles, fixed-gears have, in fact, gears which are fixed directly to the wheel. This means that for every motion forward (or backwards), both gears (known as your ratio) must also spin, in turn harnessing this power of movement through the pedals of the bicycle. This allows for a relationship with the earth's surface that is often akin to driving a stick shift car, where an intuited level of connection is formed that requires the utmost intentionality. 

## What Are the Parts?
Unlike their modern competitors, the fixed-gear bicycle is simplistic and built for minimal interface change or maintenance. There are no changing drive trains, or gear shifters, nor calipered or rim breaks. Lube up your chain, and go!
###  Frame
The frame is simplistic, with no needed gauges for break lines, though a defining featuristic is the horizontal dropouts for the rear wheel. 
### Tires
You will need many of these, as you skid your way through rubber to stop.

## In Popular Culture
When culturally addressed, fixed-gear bicycles are seen as "hipster" or counter culture. While they find their roots in the traditional bike culture, fixed-gears are found contextually in predominantly two subcultures- those of the velodrome, and the bike messenger scene. This can be seen in films such as Premium Rush, starring Joseph Gordon-Levitt, or in fixed-gear freestyle films such as Fixation. This second, the FGFS, is a mixing of subcultures with that of BMX and has taken over much of the non-speed-fixated community. Cultural hubs include New York City, San Francisco, Los Angeles, and Portland, Oregon. Who needs a pop culture reference to do something when the roads are calling, though? Get out there!
